"""Whether a checkout's own agent-spec hooks run in a KAS session, per folder.

A project-only agent (one ``<folder>/.kiro/agents`` declares and the user level
does not) carries ``hooks``: commands from a cloned folder. They run only when
:func:`hooks_enabled` says so for that folder, decided in this order:

1. The owner's own choice in Crew, ``on`` or ``off``. A Crew ``off`` beats
   kiro-cli's trust.
2. Otherwise kiro-cli's own "Trust this workspace?" record
   (:func:`kiro_crew.kiro_cli_workspace_trust.kiro_cli_trusts_folder`), read
   only. When kiro-cli later drops it, the hooks stop again.
3. Otherwise off, which is every folder today.

The record is ``project_hooks_consent.json`` on the keystone floor
(``config.loader_locations.project_hooks_consent_path``): neither the agent's file
tools nor its sandboxed shell can write it. The writers are the owner-gated
``/api/project-hooks/consent`` handler (:func:`set_choice`) and the gateway's
once-per-folder notice mark (:func:`mark_kiro_cli_notice_shown`). Every read
fails soft to "no choice".
